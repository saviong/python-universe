        "* You need to create a simple text-based [BlackJack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) game\n",
        "* The game needs to have one player versus an automated dealer.\n",
        "* The player can stand or hit.\n",
        "* The player must be able to pick their betting amount.\n",
        "* You need to keep track of the player's total money.\n",
        "* You need to alert the player of wins, losses, or busts, etc...\n",
        "\n",
        "And most importantly:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **You must use OOP and classes in some portion of your game. You can not just use functions in your game. Use classes to help you define the Deck and the Player's hand. There are many right ways to do this, so explore it well!**\n",

The expression ', '.join(map(str, self.all_cards)) converts each card to a string and joins them with commas in a single operation.​\n",

        "On each iteration, the code recreates card_list by processing the entire self.all_cards list again, overwriting the previous value. After the loop completes, card_list contains the same result as if you had run the join() operation just once outside the loop.​\n",
        "\n",
        "Better Approach\n",
